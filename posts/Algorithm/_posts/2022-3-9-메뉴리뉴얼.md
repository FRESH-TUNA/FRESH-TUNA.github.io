```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def solution(orders, course):
    result = []
    orders = [list(sorted(order)) for order in orders]

    for c in course:
        counter = Counter()
        
        for order in orders:
            for case in combinations(order, c):
                counter[case] += 1
        
        if not counter:
            continue
        
        mostCommon = counter.most_common()
        frequency = mostCommon[0][1]
        
        if frequency == 1:
            continue

        for key, count in counter.most_common():
            if frequency==count:
                result.append("".join(key))
    
    return sorted(result)
```
